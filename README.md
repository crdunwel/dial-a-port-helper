You must have have Java 1.8 to run this program.

If you have Java 1.8 then double click jar to run.

There will be an icon in your system tray that you can right click.

"Start Log Reader" will begin reading your EQ log

"Settings" will open a window where you can set your log file and config the program.

The program will create a config.json and dap-db.db files in the directory that it is run. Don't modify these files directly unless you know what you're doing
